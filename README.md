   - Utilized JOINs, GROUP BY, and HAVING to aggregate data across multiple tables.

3. Sales Analysis:
   - Analyzed total sales by pizza category, time of day, and week.
   - Identified the best-selling pizzas and peak order times.

4. Performance Metrics:
   - Calculated metrics such as average order value, customer frequency, and pizza size popularity.
   - Implemented **window functions** to rank top-performing items by sales and profit.

5. Optimization:
   - Suggested recommendations for inventory management and promotional strategies based on analysis.
   - Identified areas to increase profit margins by analyzing ingredient costs and sales performance.
