 **Pizza Sales SQL Project**

**Description**:  
This project focuses on analyzing sales data for a pizza chain to uncover key business insights and trends. The dataset includes various details like order times, pizza types, and sales quantities. The goal of the project is to optimize decision-making by providing data-driven insights into pizza sales performance.

 **Key Features**:

1. Database Design and Schema:
   - Developed a normalized schema with multiple tables (e.g., orders, pizzas, customers, transactions).
   - Ensured data integrity using primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

2. Data Queries:
   - Created complex SQL queries for data retrieval, including sales trends, popular pizza types, and customer purchase behavior.
   - Utilized JOINs, GROUP BY, and HAVING to aggregate data across multiple tables.

3. Sales Analysis:
   - Analyzed total sales by pizza category, time of day, and week.
   - Identified the best-selling pizzas and peak order times.

4. Performance Metrics:
   - Calculated metrics such as average order value, customer frequency, and pizza size popularity.
   - Implemented **window functions** to rank top-performing items by sales and profit.

5. Optimization:
   - Suggested recommendations for inventory management and promotional strategies based on analysis.
   - Identified areas to increase profit margins by analyzing ingredient costs and sales performance.
